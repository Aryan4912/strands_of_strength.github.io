      <h2>Who We Are!</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Our project, "Strands of Strength – The Confidence You Can Wear", reflects this ethos by addressing the emotional and practical needs of individuals experiencing hair loss, particularly cancer patients.We believe in empowering individuals through ethically sourced, natural hair wigs that restore confidence and provide comfort. Leveraging India’s rich tradition of hair donation, our platform ensures a transparent, consent-based ecosystem connecting hair donors, temples, salons, and wig manufacturers.

      <p>Hair loss is a common side effect for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. This often results in a loss of confidence and comfort. Synthetic wigs, while cost-effective, lack the natural look and feel, which can negatively impact the psychological well-being of patients. Addressing this challenge, we aim to make the sourcing of natural hair wigs ethical and cost-effective.
        India is considered as the largest exporter of natural hair, primarily due to cultural traditions of hair donation. Temples and salons are the primary sources of this raw material, but the current process of hair collection and wig production is highly unorganized and often lacks donor consent and transparency. Additionally, the high cost of natural hair wigs is largely due to their limited availability. By introducing a digital platform that bridges the gap between donors, suppliers, and wig manufacturers, we aim to create a sustainable and ethical solution
        </p>
      <p>Our mission is to provide affordable, high-quality natural wigs that inspire hope and dignity, while fostering awareness and societal harmony. Guided by innovation and compassion, we aim to transform the wig donation and production process into a sustainable, ethical, and user-friendly experience for all.</p>
